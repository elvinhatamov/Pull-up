### About Our Project:

Pull Up is a parking application that people can either rent the parking spot from others or become a host to rent your spot.
This app's idea is based on Airbnb for people who have some extra spots on their driveway or garage and can rent these spots to others.
Pullup’s mission is to create a world where anyone can park anywhere, and we are focused on creating a parking space-sharing platform that will handle every part of your daily life and make it more convenient.

- The app allows users to log in to the website and access their profile, where a list of their products for sale are shown.
- The profile page includes seller information and the collection of items they have purchased previously.
- The app's home page illustrates a wide array of products, which are filterable by category type.
- Clicking a product, users will see a more detailed page that provides further information. Users can add a product to their cart either from the home page or the detail page. When a user is ready to make a purchase, they can view their cart and hit checkout. Products will then be added to the users collection on their profile page.

### Usage:

In this porject, we used the package for our cart from the online source.
For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/django-shopping-cart/)

### Next Steps:

Moving forward, a few items to further implement would be:

1. Implement payment at checkout functionality
2. Adding a reviews component to a product
3. Applying additional filter features to the home page
4. Adding a follow feature on a users profile so shoppers can follow their favourite accounts
